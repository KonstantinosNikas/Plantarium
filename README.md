# Plantarium

A Java project for plant‑related utilities. The repository looks like a classic **NetBeans/Ant** project with `src/`, `build/`, `dist/`, and `nbproject/` folders.

> ℹ️ This README is a starter. If you share a short app summary (what Plantarium does), I’ll tailor the sections (features, usage examples, screenshots) precisely to your code.

---

## ✨ Overview

Plantarium is a Java application. The exact functionality isn’t described in the repository yet; use this space to summarize the purpose (e.g., “track plant care schedules”, “identify species”, or “manage a local plant catalog”).

## 🗂️ Project structure

```
Plantarium/
├─ src/          # Java source code (packages live here)
├─ build/        # Compiler outputs (generated)
├─ dist/         # Distribution artifacts (e.g., Plantarium.jar)
└─ nbproject/    # NetBeans project metadata
```

---

## 🧰 Requirements

* **JDK 8+** (Adoptium Temurin or Oracle JDK)
* (Optional) **NetBeans IDE** (or any IDE that can import Ant projects)
* If it turns out to be an Android project, use **Android Studio** and a modern JDK (17+)—see the Android note below.

---

## 🚀 Build & Run

### Option A — NetBeans (Ant project)

1. **Open** the project in NetBeans (`File → Open Project…`).
2. Click **Build**. NetBeans generates the artifact under `dist/` (e.g., `dist/Plantarium.jar`).
3. **Run** directly from NetBeans or via command line:

   ```bash
   java -jar dist/Plantarium.jar
   ```

### Option B — Command line (Ant)

If there is a `build.xml` at the repo root (typical for NetBeans projects):

```bash
# build
ant clean jar

# run
java -jar dist/Plantarium.jar
```

> Install Ant if needed (macOS: `brew install ant`, Ubuntu: `sudo apt install ant`).

### Android note (only if applicable)

If `src/` contains Android packages (e.g., `AndroidManifest.xml`) and Gradle files are added later, open the project in **Android Studio** and build with **Gradle**. Replace this section with the exact modules/instructions (`app/`, `:core`, etc.).

## ⚙️ Configuration

Document any runtime configuration here (e.g., properties files, environment variables). Example:

```
config/
  application.properties
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Describe how to run tests if present. Example:

```bash
# JUnit via Ant target
ant test
```

Add CI (GitHub Actions) later to run tests on push/PR.

---

## 📦 Packaging & Release

* Build produces a **runnable JAR** in `dist/`.
* Create a GitHub **Release** and attach the JAR for users to download.

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap (sample)

* Add a short **CLI** or **GUI** (Swing/JavaFX) to expose features
* Configuration file with sensible defaults
* Unit tests with JUnit 5
* GitHub Actions workflow (`java‑ci.yml`)
* Documentation: examples, screenshots, and FAQ

---

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repo & create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Commit with a conventional message: `feat: add watering schedule view`
3. Push and open a Pull Request.

## 📜 License

No license file is present. Consider adding an **MIT License** (`LICENSE`) if you want to allow open use.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

* Thanks to the Java and NetBeans communities for tooling & templates.
